######Do you want archiving? If so what kind?
It can wait until phase 2 when multiple data sets are being used.
######Which stats do you want displayed?
The ones we have listed are fine.
######Do you want mortality for different age groups displayed?
No
######Which part of SIA do you want displayed?
SIA(disabled) is in the same format as the rest of the data.
######Is there a difference between 0 and NA?
Yes, 0 means 0 and NA means there is no data.
######Do X1-X32 correspond to 1980-2011?
All ouput files have x1-x32 and they correspond to 1981-2012, estimates cannot be made for 1980 because there is no data to base it on.
######How do you want stats labeled?
Depends on how large the display area is. Current labels are fine except cases should be reported cases. MCV stands for measles containing vaccine, mcv1 should/could be labeled first dose coverage.

Not necessarily important to you but data on a 0-1 scale should be converted to a 0-100 scale.
