# Code Commit Checklist

Ask yourself these questions before you commit your code:

* Does my code follow the coding standards of Stateware?
* Is my code commented well enough for another person to easily understand it?
* Are my functions unit tested?
* Are all parts of my commit functional?
* Are my commit title and description descriptive and follow the guidelines set by my team leader?

##### If your answer to any of the above questions is "no", you should work more on your code before committing

* Is this the correct branch to commit to?
* Have I pulled from this branch yet?
* Does my code follow the agreed upon design for my task?
* Does everyone else working on the task know that I am committing?
* Is my commit going to be incompatible with any dependencies?

##### If your answer to any of the above questions is "no", you should discuss your commit with your team and team leader
